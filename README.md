# FDF

Fdf or "fil de fer" is my very first graphics project.

## Key learnings 

- looking into parsing with this one using my [Get_next_line] (https://github.com/emmameinert/Hiveproject_gnl)https://github.com/emmameinert/Hiveproject_gnl function
  
- making a 2D map 3D looking with isometric projection.
  
- coming up with a line drawing algorithm using [linear interpolation] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_interpolation)https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_interpolation
  
- learning to use a graphics library (mlx, given by the 42school in this case)
  
- getting deeper knowledge of the use of structs (e.g. using them as coordinates)

## Isometric projection

Isometric projection is used for giving 2D drawings depth and make them look like 3D.

This is done by using a Rotation matrix on each coordinate of the map with a specific angle.
